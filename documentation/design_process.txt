The first idea was an app that could generate a random cooking method (e.g. boiling, frying... etc...) and randomly generate a recipe based on the method. Additional randomness was still required and I toyed with the idea of a randomly generated level of spice, random course (starter, main...). 

This would have required a lot of database design and a lot of work put into many to many relationships within a database for the allowed elements for ingredients and so on... 

I then thought about making the application more of a game for the user where they are given a small list of randomly generated ingredients they need to use. Additionally a random method of cooking could be generated. The end goal being for the user to decide to decide if they could make something with the recipe and name it. The recipe is then saved to a database with the ingredients and method as well as name.
